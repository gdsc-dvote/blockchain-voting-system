# dVote (Decentralized-Vote)

### Voter and electoral fraud are persistent problems endured by organisations of all types and sizes - from student governments to national governments. Examples of voter fraud are voting by impersonation and voting by ineligible voters. Electoral fraud can occur if election officials maliciously alter or remove ballots that are cast. In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic has made it difficult for elections to be held in person, but organisations are weary of moving elections online due to concerns of cyberattacks or data manipulation.

&nbsp;

### To solve this problem, we leverage the blockchain techonology which aims to provides the necessary transparency and accountability in elections.

# Starting local frontend

Make a `.env` file in the `frontend` directory. With the following fields

`REACT_APP_API_URL`="..."

`REACT_APP_FIREBASE_API_KEY`="..."

`REACT_APP_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN`="..."

Replace the ... above with the following:

Put the URL of the backend server in the field `REACT_APP_API_URL`. Remove the domain and do NOT end the url in a forward slash.  
In the other 2 fields put the firebase api key and auth domain which can be obtained from your firebase account.

Now, make sure you are in the `blockchain-voting-system` directory and run the following command

```console
$ cd frontend && npm install
```

After all the project dependencies have been installed run the following in the frontend directory

```console
$ npm start
```

The frontend will be accessible on `localhost:3000`

Note: For the frontend to work, the local server should also be running. To start the server look at the instructions below. Any interaction with blockchain requires some time. Please be patient

# Starting local server  

Note: To do this you will either need your own blockchain network or you can connect your own node to our network and enable JSON-RPC endpoints on it  


Make a `.env` file in the `backend` directory. With the following fields

`URL`="..."

`MNEMONIC`="..."

`DATABASE`="..."

Replace the ... above with the following:

Put the URL of your blockchain node in the field `URL`.  
Choose a 12 word mnemonic phrase to initialize the HDWallet. Put this phrase in the `MNEMONIC` field.  
In the `DATABASE` field put the URL of the firebase database which can be obtained from your firebase console.

Next, download the firebase service account file from firebase console, rename it to `service-account.json` and put it in the `backend` directory.

Now, make sure you are in the `blockchain-voting-system` directory and run the following command

```console
$ cd backend && npm install
```

After all the project dependencies have been installed run the following in the backend directory

```console
$ npm start
```

The local server is listening on `localhost:5000`

To run just the server, refer to `API.md` on how to use the APIs using Postman or cURL  
Note that since the server interacts with a blockchain, certain actions can take more time to respond since they need to be mined on the blockchain first.

Note: Any interaction with blockchain requires some time. Please be patient

# Connecting to our blockchain network

Note: This isn't necessary to run our webapp. You can use this to manually verify the blockchain interactions that occur when using the webapp.

You can use Ethereum Clique protocol supporting clients like [Geth](https://geth.ethereum.org/docs/install-and-build/installing-geth) to setup a node that connects to our blockchain network using:

`networkid: 392`  
Use can use any of the following bootnodes:

- `"enode://244c89873fba7ade0cc70084b1d225dd7ab7b3559fd7509cd270b7347fb09f85064b9c18b877c057f71351c19f2b780f61795763642f4f6a7928a7f850e6b8d3@104.154.251.135:30303"`
